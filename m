What is responsible for choosing which of these policies to use?

Surely, if Linux's stub started using TPM2_PCR_Event, it would first
hash any large inputs and then send the _hash_ to TPM2_PCR_Event
instead of, say, bit-banging the entire initramfs to the TPM.  But
you're talking about the ACM and I'm talking about the Linux stub code
in this patchset.

But the capping-with-"1" does suggest that maybe one can actually cap
with "1" without preventing downstream software from consuming the
event log.

Sure, a "carte blanche" attack in the sense that the PCRs are entirely
blank won't happen, but if any component in the chain does not extend
a bank, then an attacker can replace the code _after_ that component
without being noticed.

This seems to be at least not terrible.

Or I suppose one could use TPM_HASH_ functions? The spec for them is
somewhat impenetrable to me.

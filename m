I agree. But in our use case scenario, we want the attestation service 
to know who signed the system files and leave the task of validating the 
file signature to the clients.

Essentially, in our approach we are measuring the "signer".

In my implementation I am measuring the builtin keys. Since any key 
added to the secondary keyring also needs to be signed by a key in the 
builtin keyring, I feel measuring only "builtin keys" is sufficient.

But I am open to the suggestion of measuring secondary keys as well. 
Please let me know if you think that is a must.

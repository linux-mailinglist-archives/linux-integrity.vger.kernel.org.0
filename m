Hi Michael

yes, this is one of the problems of doing file measurements with
parallel execution. It is a property of the TPM PCR extension, to bind
the current measurement to the previous ones. It is for security
reasons, to avoid an attacker to go back to when there were only good
measurements.

Yes, with the current measurement approach it is not feasible.

PCR 10 was intended to protect the integrity of measurements, to be
sent to remote verifiers. Those verifiers, by seeing the measurements,
can conclude if the properties they are interested in are successfully
verified or not.

I have developed a solution that does what you want. It is called
DIGLIM:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210914163401.864635-1-roberto.sassu@huawei.com/

At boot time, before init, it extends a PCR with a list of digests of
files from your disk (or better, from your Linux distribution, signed
by the vendor). IMA then searches the digest of the files being
accessed at run-time in that preloaded list. If it finds it, it does
not further extend the PCR. Otherwise, it extends the PCR.

With this scheme, the PCR is again predictable and you can seal keys
with it. After an unknown file was accessed, the key becomes unusable
(due to the PCR extend).

I actually implemented a library:

https://github.com/openeuler-mirror/attest-tools

to generate keys and certificates to be used for a TLS connection. The
key is bound to the list of file digests (and to the other components
involved in the boot process). It requires openssl_tpm2_engine from
James Bottomley.

Yes, this is more or less what DIGLIM was at the beginning.

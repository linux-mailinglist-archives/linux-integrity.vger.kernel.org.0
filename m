A general remark that's always worth repeating: under no circumstances
should the object that you're operating on change from .open to
.read/.write. Consider the following very rough sketch:

	pid = fork():
	if (pid == 0) {
		// create USERNS1
		unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER);
	
		// write an idmapping for getuid() to userns 0
	
		mount("", "/sys/kernel/security", "securityfs", [...]);
	
		int fd_ima = open("/sys/kernel/security/some_ima_file", O_WRONLY);
	
		// Send fd_ima to parent via SCM_RIGHTS
	}
	// Receive fd_ima from child.
	
	write(fd_ima, "SET_OPTION_ON_INIT_USER_NS", ...); 

That example above is an instant security issue if the ima_ns changed
depending on the caller since it means you could open a file in an
unprivileged userns and then funnel it to a random process in
init_user_ns that you control via SCM_RIGHTS and have it do the write()
and instead of USERNS1->ima_ns you'd suddenly have changed
init_user_ns->ima_ns.
And this is what your previous patch with these multiple
get_current_ns() calls allowed.

So the write in the example above must operate on USERNS1->ima_ns.

Now, both option 1 and 2 will ensure that the ima_ns that is operated on
is always the same across .open/.read/.write:
1. securityfs->sb->s_user_ns->ima_ns this is trivially guaranteed
   because the filesystem's user namespace doesn't change no matter
   where you access that filesystem from.
2. securityfs_file->f_cred->user_ns->ima_ns this is guaranteed because
   f_cred stashes the openers credentials.

What I fundamentally dislike about option 2 (f_cred) is - and I tried to
say that in my prior mail - that what ima_ns is operated on depends on
the userns of the process that called .open, i.e. the contents in
securityfs change depending on the opener's userns.

And I think that is fundamentally sloppy semantics. The contents of a
filesystem should generally not depend on the caller if it can be
avoided. We have a few instances where this is the case (e.g. some
procfs sysctls) but especially for securityfs this does not make sense.

If you're really worried about someone being able to access a securityfs
instance whose userns doesn't match the userns the securityfs instance
was mounted in there are multiple ways to fix it. The one that I tend to
prefer is:

securityfs: only allow access to securityfs from within same namespace

Limit opening of securityfs files to callers located in the same namespace.

In general, never do permission checking at read/write time unless the
read/write fundamentally depends on what is read or written. Clean
semantics will do permission checking once at open time. If you really
really need to do permission checking at .read/.write time you need to
use f_cred possibly calling override_creds/revert_creds() while doing so
but simply don't do it.

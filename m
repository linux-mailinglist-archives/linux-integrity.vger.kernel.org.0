It does seem rather straight-forward, and it doesn't have to be specific=
 to TXT either. I.e., we should probably always measure the runtime enab=
led/disabled state into the PCRs.

But given the actual problem at hand (untrustworthy glue code running in=
 ring 3 that does little more than poke SMM, which itself fundamentally =
remains part of the TCB), it would be nice if we could just sandbox that=
 code using virtualization.

This came up in a separate discussion regarding ACPI PRM (the new dumpin=
g ground for evil vendor code now that SMM has gone out of fashion), alt=
hough there it should be feasible to run it unprivileged, as the spec re=
quires that capability for the PRM payloads.

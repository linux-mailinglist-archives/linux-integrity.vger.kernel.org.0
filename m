One more bump here, as we'd really love to get encrypted hibernation
to a form upstream would accept if at all possible. We were
considering landing this in our Chrome OS tree for now, then coming
back in a couple months with a "we've been baking this ourselves and
it's going so great, oooh yeah". I'm not sure if upstream would find
that compelling or not. But in any case, some guidance towards making
this more upstream friendly would be well appreciated.

One thing I realized in attempting to pick this myself is that the
trusted key blob format has moved to ASN.1. So I should really move
the creation ticket to the new ASN.1 format (if I can figure out the
right OID for that piece), which would allow me to drop a lot of the
ugly stuff in tpm2_unpack_blob(). Maybe if I get no other comments
I'll work on that and resend.

Dear Beloved,

I am Mrs Nicole Benoite Marois and i have been suffering from ovarian
cancer disease and the doctor says that i have just few days to leave.
I am from (Paris) France but based in Africa Burkina Faso since eight
years ago as a business woman dealing with gold exportation.

Now that i am about to end the race like this, without any family
members and no child. I have $3 Million US DOLLARS in Africa
Development Bank (ADB) Burkina Faso which i instructed the bank to remit and
give to Orphanage & Teaching Volunteer Work in Burkina Faso.But my
mind is not at
rest because i am writing this letter now through the help of my
computer beside my sick bed.

I also have $4.5 Million US Dollars at Eco-Bank here in Burkina Faso
and i instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as foreigner
that will apply to the bank after i have gone, that they should
release the fund to him/her,but you will assure me that you will take
50% of the fund and give 50% to the orphanages home in your country
for my heart to rest.

Respond to me immediately via my private email address
(mrsnicole.france1958@outlook.com) for further details since I have just
few days to end my life due to the ovarian cancer disease, hoping you
will understand my point

Yours fairly friend,

Mrs Nicole Benoite Marois.

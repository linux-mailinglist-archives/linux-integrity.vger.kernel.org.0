Normally new features aren't back ported to stable, but for some
reason this was back ported to stable linux-4.14.y.

In the future, using "git blame" will identify the patch in which a
new feature is added. Â From there, you can use "git branch -r --
contains <commit number>" to see in which release it was introduced.

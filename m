The sysfs is not done, fundamentally, because the sysfs structure of
the existing TPM1 stuff is grandfathered in, and doing anything like
it for TPM2 is a complete NAK for not following the normal sysfs
interface design rules, particularly of one value per file. This is a
big part of why it was dropped for TPM2.

So exposing PCRs and things through sysfs is not going to happen.

If you had some very narrowly defined things like version, then
*maybe* but I think a well defined use case is needed for why this
needs to be sysfs and can't be done in C as Jarkko explained.

A good reason would be something like needing to trigger a systemd
unit from udev.

The first two patches are fine. Â From the test, I'm seeing the
following results:

evm_overlay 1 TINFO: overwrite file in overlay
tst_rod: Failed to open '(null)' for writing: Operation not permitted
evm_overlay 1 TFAIL: echo overlay > mntpoint/merged/foo1.txt failed unexpectedly
evm_overlay 2 TINFO: append file in overlay: mntpoint/lower/foo2.txt
evm_overlay 2 TPASS: echo overlay >> mntpoint/merged/foo2.txt passed as expected
evm_overlay 3 TINFO: create a new file in overlay
evm_overlay 3 TPASS: echo overlay > mntpoint/merged/foo3.txt passed as expected
evm_overlay 4 TINFO: read all created files
evm_overlay 4 TFAIL: cat mntpoint/merged/foo1.txt > /dev/null 2> /dev/null failed unexpectedly
evm_overlay 4 TFAIL: cat mntpoint/merged/foo2.txt > /dev/null 2> /dev/null failed unexpectedly
evm_overlay 4 TFAIL: cat mntpoint/merged/foo3.txt > /dev/null 2> /dev/null failed unexpectedly
evm_overlay 5 TINFO: SELinux enabled in enforcing mode, this may affect test results
evm_overlay 5 TINFO: You can try to disable it with TST_DISABLE_SELINUX=1 (requires super/root)
evm_overlay 5 TINFO: loaded SELinux profiles: none

With "evm: instead of using the overlayfs i_ino, use the real i_ino"
patch, I'm only seeing the first failure.

Yes, that is my original try.

You got it.

If using my second method, it means to unpack the UKI image in user
space, and pass the kernel image, initrd and cmdline through
kexec_file_load interface. If the UKI can have signature on the initrd
and cmdline, we extend the capability of that interface to check those
verification.

Sorry that maybe there is no document. I understand them through the code.
The zboot image, aka, vmlinuz.efi looks like:
PE header, which is formed manually in arch/arm64/kernel/head.S
EFI decompressor, which consists of
drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/zboot.c and libstub
Image.gz, which is formed by compressing Image as instructed in Makefile.zb=

Yes, I agree. That method is attractive, originally I had a try when
Ard suggested it but there was no clear boundary on which boot service
should be implemented for zboot, so I did not move on along that
direction.

Now, UKI poses another challenge to kexec_file_load, and seems to
require more than zboot. And it appears that Ard's approach is a
silver bullet for that issue.

I try to answer part of the questions.

My crude assumption: this new stub will replace the purgatory, and I
am not sure whether kexec-tools source tree will accommodate it. It
can be signed and checked during the kexec_file_load.

I think the runtime services survive through the kexec process. It is
derived from the real firmware, not related with this stub

Besides these questions, I wonder whether a highly configured EDK2 can
be used as the stub (ArmVirtQemuKernel.dsc can be the start point).
But there should be efforts to exclude the drivers which have the MMIO
access. I saw Ard is active in EDK2, maybe that is the reason why he
did not pick up EDK2 to serve the stub.

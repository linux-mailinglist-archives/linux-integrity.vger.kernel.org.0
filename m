I don't think that would work: The in-kernel resource manager will
context save the session while the userspace program isn't using the
TPM (so that's while a TPM device read/write is active), so even if you
hold the process running or even the /dev/tpmrm0 fd open, the session
won't be in a state to pass into the kernel.  What you really have to
do to get this to work is to bypass the resource manager because you're
trying to share a session between two otherwise separately managed uses
of the TPM.

Using a session constructed elsewhere is a security problem anyway
because you can't share nonces, so the policy patches that stalled a
year or so ago fixed this by allowing the kernel itself to construct
the policy session, so you didn't have to pass in the handle:

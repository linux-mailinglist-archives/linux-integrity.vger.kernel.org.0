I've read the TPM standard a bit, but it's been awhile, and it's too
complicated anyway.  So, can you remind me (and probably 3/4 of the
other people on this thread, too):

What, exactly, is your patchset doing that requires hashing at all?
(I assume it's extending a PCR and generating an event log entry.).
What, exactly, does it mean to "cap" a PCR?  How is this different
from what your patchset does?

With that answered, it will hopefully be easy to see that you're
making the right call :)

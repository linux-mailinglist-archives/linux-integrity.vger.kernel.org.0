I needed to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ima_measure_critical_data); otherwise I
couldn't compile.. not sure but I can only imagine you compile DM
(and all targets) to be builtin?

In addition to fixing that (in first table load patch) I changed
various things along the way while I reviewed each patch.

Things that I recall are:
- moved #ifdef CONFIG_IMA from dm-ima.c to dm-ima.h
- fixed various typos and whitespace
- consistently prepend "," in STATUSTYPE_IMA's DMEMIT()s as opposed to
  having a mix or pre and postfix throughout targets
- fixed what seemed like malformed STATUSTYPE_IMA handling for
  dm-multipath -- it was DMEMIT(";") for each dm-mpath's pathgroup
- added some fields to dm-mpath, renamed some IMA names in name=value
  pairs to be more clear.

I've staged the result in linux-next via linux-dm.git's dm-5.15
branch, see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=dm-5.15

I've compiled tested both with and without CONFIG_IMA set.  But
haven't actually tested the code.

Please send any incremental fixes relative to the dm-5.15 branch and
I'll get them folded in where appropriate.

Thanks,
Mike

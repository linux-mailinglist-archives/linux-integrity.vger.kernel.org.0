As you mentioned, this is not unique to the DRTM case, but allow me to 
provide our perspective. We would enjoy a sysfs controlled lock that 
results in a PCR Event. With that said, while it may be getting down 
into the implementation details, I would like to suggest the PCR be 
configurable. When under DRTM, it would be desirable to have the ability 
for the measurement to be extended into a DRTM PCR.

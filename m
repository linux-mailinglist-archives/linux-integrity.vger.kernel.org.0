Once the key measurement is defined and upstreamed, changing it would
result in a regression. Â If we think that it would change multiple
times, then perhaps the buffer measurement needs to contain some sort
of versioning.

I would very much like for a regression test to be included in this
patch set, but it isn't a requirement, as long as everything needed
for verifying a signature is included in the key measurement.

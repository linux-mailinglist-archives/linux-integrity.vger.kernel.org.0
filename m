To me it still feels trivial write an application to do this same thing
in userspace with ioctls to the char device (figure out what interface
the TPM is using, get basic capabilities, etc.). There isn't anything
here that the kernel can do that can't be done from userspace that I can
see. Is this not true? Maybe its less code in the kernel but I don't
know that that's a great reason.

I don't see a clear advantage to putting the code in the kernel, but I
do see disadvantages. Interfaces between kernel and userspace need to be
more rigid to avoid breakage.

Thanks,
Jordan

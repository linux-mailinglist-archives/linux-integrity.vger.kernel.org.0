The measurements could be added to an IMA pending measurement
workqueue, until the TPM is enabled, assuming there is a TPM, and then
processed. Â All of this code would be within IMA.

So your intention is only to measure the initial keys added to these
keyrings, not anything subsequently added to the secondary keyring?

Defining an LSM/IMA hook to measure keys, based on policy, seems
cleaner and more useful.

That is great to hear!

> Surprisingly, even when doing a secure launch, the EFI runtime services still work happily, which means (AIUI) that code that was excluded from the D-RTM TCB is still being executed at ring 0? Doesn't this defeat D-RTM entirely in the case some exploit is hidden in the EFI runtime code? Should we measure the contents of EfiRuntimeServicesCode regions too?

Yes, in fact in the early days I specifically stated that we should 
provide for the ability to measure the RS blocks. Particularly if you 
are not in an environment where you can isolate the calls to RS from the 
TCB. While the RS can pose runtime corruption risks, the larger concern 
is integrating the D-RTM validation of the Intel System Resources 
Defense (ISRD), aka SMI isolation/SMM Supervisor, provided by the Intel 
System Security Report (ISSR). Within the ISSR is a list of memory 
regions which the SMM Policy Shim (SPS) restricts a SMI handler's access 
when running. This allows a kernel to restrict what access a SMI handler 
are able to reach, thus allowing them to be removed from the TCB when 
the appropriate guards are put in place.

If you are interested in understanding these further, Satoshi Tanda has 
probably the best technical explanation without Intel market speak.

> The way the work is divided between GRUB and Linux seems to be predicated entirely (at least originally) on the idea that the GRUB->Linux handover and the secure launch should be one and the same. I.e., GRUB sets the stage, pokes the ACM, which returns to the loaded linux image and boots it. This requires a lot of coordination, e.g., putting a MLE header in the kernel image and exposing it to GRUB in a certain manner, resource tables and other things that have to remain in sync between both sides.

I would add one clarification, where you say GRUB, we would say any 
bootloader and where you say Linux, we would say any kernel that could 
be started with D-RTM. While you all care about Linux specifically, the 
goal for TrenchBoot is to build a common approach that we can implement
across any other open source OS.

(For legacy boot, it should be feasible to call back into GRUB too, although it would be more of a ad-hoc construction, via the SLR table perhaps.) But no kernel_info and MLE headers etc being added to the ABI surface. Also, there is no longer a need for the GRUB code to understand how the decompressor is constructed, with a setup block etc, or take special care to perform PMR checks when its moves itself around in memory.

> [*] which I still don't get: why is it fine to cap other banks with a single 0x1 byte [as the ACM does too, apparently], but do we require an SHA-1 implementation for capping the SHA-1 banks? Also, the TXT spec dropped all support for TPM1.2 so I wonder if that should be dropped from this series as well.

I think this is a great approach for UEFI, though we need to reconcile 
this with non-UEFI situations such as booting under coreboot. The one 
concern we have before committing to yet another rework is to get 
confirmation from the x86 maintainers. Would they be okay with a new 
entry point into the mainline kernel, or any other major sticking points 
they might see from this approach?

Dave Hansen, since you have been helping us as an x86 maintainer, would 
be willing to provide feedback on our concerns moving forward with the 
above proposal?

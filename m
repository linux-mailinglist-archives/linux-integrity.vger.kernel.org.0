Why would that be necessary though? The "name" of an nvindex pins the
access policy of the nvindex. And nvindexes are always created
uninitialized, thus to to initialize one you just created
(i.e. execute the first write to it) you must be able to fulfill the
write policy set for it. But if you can do that, then why bother with
deleting/recreating them in the first place? And if you set a
different access policy on them then the "name" of the nvindex would
change, and it would become useless in all references from other
objects/quotes/â€¦

This logic is explicitly mentioned in that tpm book btw, it took me a
while to grok how great that concept is, since it basically means you
don't have to be concerned about removed/readded nvindexes at all.

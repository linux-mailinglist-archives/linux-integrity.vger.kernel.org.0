Aren't PGP keys simply RSA / ECC / EdDSA keys with additional metadata?
Can't they be unwrapped from their (complex) PGP format in userspace and
loaded raw into the kernel, in a similar way as they are sometimes used
for SSH authentication?

This will save us from having to add complex parsers (a well-known source
of bugs) into the kernel - I guess there aren't any plans to add an
in-kernel PGP Web of Trust implementation.

Thanks,
Maciej

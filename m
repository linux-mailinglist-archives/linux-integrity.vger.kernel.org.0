Hi Janne,

As I mentioned previously I know very little about the approach you had 
mentioned. I read a little more on it and I think now I understand it a 
little better and yes, it should actually work.

 Â I will spend some time familiarizing myself with how this would work 
so I can actually compare both approaches myself on a technical level 
and have a more well informed opinion on the matter before moving on 
with either sending an RFC for the first approach (based on your code 
from last year) or starting some work using the new approach you brought up.

Thanks,

-Raphael

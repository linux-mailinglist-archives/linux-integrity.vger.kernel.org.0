IMA doesn't hard code policy in the kernel, but is based on a single,
centralized policy, which contains measurement, appraisal, and audit
rules. Â Just as the new IMA appended signature support (kernel module
signature format)[1] contains a new "appraise_type=imasig|modsig"
option, there would be a similar option for fs-verity.

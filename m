This delta from "acpidump for Dell XPS 9310 (with Qualcomm QCA6390)" to
"acpidump output from a Dell XPS 13 9310 that no longer has a problem"
in SSDT7. The bug I'm referring to is

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1920510

Looks to me just using a different label.

What if we just set "interrupts=0" explicitly for STM0125 HID since the
workaround seems to work according to the report?
